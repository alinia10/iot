# Lamp Control and Temperature Monitoring using Flutter, Embedded Programming, C# MQTT and DevOps

# Project Overview

This project is an IoT-based solution that allows users to control lamps and monitor temperature using a Flutter-based mobile application, embedded programming, C# MQTT, and DevOps practices.

The project is divided into four main components:

1. **Embedded Programming** - This component involves programming a microcontroller to read temperature data and control the lamps. The microcontroller is connected to an MQTT broker that publishes temperature data and listens to messages to control the lamps.

2. **C# MQTT** - This component involves programming a C# application to act as an MQTT broker that communicates with the embedded programming component and the Flutter-based mobile application.

3. **Flutter-Based Mobile Application** - This component involves programming a mobile application using the Flutter framework that communicates with the MQTT broker to control the lamps and display temperature data.

4. **DevOps** - This component involves using tools and practices such as version control, continuous integration, and continuous deployment to streamline the development and deployment process.

# Requirements

- Flutter SDK
- C# .NET Framework
- MQTT Broker
- Microcontroller
- Lamps
- Git
- CI/CD tool (e.g., Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI)

# Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the embedded programming code in an IDE of your choice and upload it to the microcontroller.
3. Install the MQTT broker and configure it.
4. Open the C# code in an IDE of your choice and configure the connection to the MQTT broker.
5. Open the Flutter code in an IDE of your choice and configure the connection to the MQTT broker.
6. Run the C# application, Flutter application, and microcontroller.

# Usage

1. Open the Flutter-based mobile application and connect to the MQTT broker.
2. Turn on or off the lamps from the mobile application.
3. View the temperature data on the mobile application.
